Hello everyone, my name is Rodion. I'm seventeen years old. 
And I am a student of the Minsk Radio Engineering College and currently studying front-end development at RS School. 
I have a strong interest in web development and aspire to become a professional web developer in the near future.
In general, I'm an ambitious guy from Minsk who loves sports, programming and good rest in a good company :)

As for my education, I just finished school. And I went to college last year.

My main goal is to find a job in a team of professional developers where I can learn and grow as a developer by participating in the team's projects. 
I believe that working with experienced programmers is a great opportunity to develop your skills and prepare for future challenges.

My motivation to get into programming stems from my passion for creating innovative and engaging web applications that enhance the user experience. 
The possibilities that programming offers are endless and I enjoy exploring new ways to implement design and functionality in my projects. 
It is also very interesting to understand algorithms and write them yourself.

I recently worked on a project where I developed a minesweeper game. 
The goal of this project was to understand native JS and develop my skills in building JS web applications. 
Throughout the process, I encountered various problems, such as creating algorithms for the game, splitting the code into modules, and so on. 
But perseverance and hard work led to successful results.

Also, in my free time, I started making a weather forecast web application project in VUE.js using several APIs.

Overall, I am excited to continue my journey as a web developer and look forward to learning and collaborating with other professionals in the field. Thank you for watching!
